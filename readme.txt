NSK is a sample application produced by Managed Designs (http://www.manageddesigns.it) 
and intended to be used as a blueprint when designing and implementing a .NET layered application architecture.
The application uses the standard Northwind database, as included in Microsoft SQL Server: no modifications to
the database schema are required in order to install and run the starter kit.
